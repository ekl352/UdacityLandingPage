# Udacity Landing Page

Practicing different Javascript techniques, mainly DOM traversal, through Udacity's landing page project. In this project the main goals are to use Javascript to dynamically build a navigation menu, change the active state of each section of that menu in view to highlight which section is in view, and to add smooth scrolling through Javascript.

### Prerequisites

You will just need a basic code editor and browser to install this project.

### Project Description

Most of the HTML and CSS is provided by Udacity for this project, it could easily be editable. The Javascript code is imported into the index.html file. The Javascript code is what adds the functionality of smooth scroll, changing your 'active view' for each section, and dynamically building a navigation menu. Most of these were achieved with the forEach() method, and Event Listeners of scroll to tell which section is in the active view.

### Instructions

To add a navigation dynamically, achieve smooth scroll, and focus in on an active section, you can find all the code in the Javascript file to do this. Although, smooth scroll can now be easily applied with a CSS Class.
